cat <<'DONE'

Done. Next:
  1. Restart Claude Code (so the skill and any tracker MCP tools load).
  2. Connect a Linear or Atlassian (Jira) MCP if you haven't.
  3. In any project, just ask — no command needed:
       "create a ticket for this bug"   "file a Linear issue for the discount bug"
       "open a Jira ticket: add CSV export to reports"   or  /ticket
     First run in a project, it asks once which tracker + team/project to use,
     then remembers it in .claude/tickets.local.json.

It writes short, human-readable tickets (reproduction + verification + where the
problem is), pulls any Figma/design/screenshot links from the chat into the ticket,
and posts recent test results as a comment.
DONE
