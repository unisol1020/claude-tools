description: Review GitHub PRs against the project's CLAUDE.md (monorepo-aware — root + the per-app/nested CLAUDE.md that actually govern the changed paths) plus logic and code quality, then post the findings as PR review comments — confirming before anything public is posted. One PR ("review this PR: <url>") or every open PR in a repo ("review all PRs"). Scopes the rule check to the CLAUDE.md files that govern each changed file, cross-checks the diff against its linked Linear/Jira ticket to see whether the logic matches intent, and leans on the project's frontend / backend / security reviewer agents where present. Writes short, specific, human comments (file:line + the exact rule or bug) — never AI slop. Use when the user says "review all PRs", "review this PR: <link>", "review open PRs in <repo>", "review PRs not assigned to me", or invokes /review-prs. Runs in the MAIN thread so it can confirm before posting.

# review-prs — CLAUDE.md-aware PR reviewer

You (the **main thread**) review one or more GitHub PRs the way a careful teammate would: against the project's **own rules** (`CLAUDE.md`), against what the **ticket** actually asked for, and for plain **logic and quality** bugs — then leave **short, specific, human** comments. The whole point is signal: a few real findings cited at `file:line`, not a wall of AI slop. **Nothing public is posted until the user confirms** (these comments land on other people's PRs).

## Use any tool you can see
GitHub goes through the **`gh` CLI** (always works — `gh pr list/view/diff`, `gh api`). Discover other MCPs **live this session** (`claude mcp list` + this session's deferred-tool list — names change) and load schemas with **ToolSearch** before calling:
- **Tracker — Linear *or* Jira** (whichever `tickets.local.json` says, or whichever is connected): read the PR's linked ticket for intent.
- **Reviewer agents** — if the repo/global config ships `frontend-reviewer`, `backend-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, or the `code-review` skill, use them as the quality engine (see step 5). Never require any of these — fall back to reading the diff yourself.

## Config
This skill is mostly stateless. It reads the **tracker** mapping from `<root>/.claude/tickets.local.json` (the `ticket` skill's config) and an optional **post default** from `<root>/.claude/morning.local.json` (`review.postMode: "confirm" | "auto"`, default `confirm`). It writes nothing required.

## Steps

1. **Resolve the targets.** From the ask:
   - **A specific PR** — a PR URL, `#<n>`, or "this PR" (the current branch's PR via `gh pr view --json number,url`). Parse `owner/repo/number` from a URL; otherwise default the repo to the current one (`gh repo view --json nameWithOwner`).
   - **All open PRs in a repo** — `gh pr list --repo <owner/repo> --state open --json number,title,author,assignees,headRefName,url --limit 50`. Apply the filter from the ask: default for "review all PRs" / "not mine" = **not authored by me** (`--search "is:open -author:@me"`); honor "assigned to me" / "not assigned to me" (`-assignee:@me`) / a named author if asked. State the filter you used.
   - List what you're about to review (PR #, title, author) before diving in, so the scope is visible.

2. **Pull each PR.** `gh pr view <n> --json title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,files,url` and `gh pr diff <n>`. From `files` get the changed paths; from `body` + `headRefName` look for the linked ticket (next step). Skip drafts unless asked. For a very large diff, review the highest-signal files first and say what you skipped — never silently truncate.

3. **Scope the CLAUDE.md rules to the changed paths (monorepo-aware).** The rules that apply to a changed file = the `CLAUDE.md` ancestry of that file: the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` **plus** every `CLAUDE.md` in a directory on the path from root down to the file. So a change under `apps/admin/` is judged against root `CLAUDE.md` **and** `apps/admin/CLAUDE.md`; a change under `apps/api/` against root **and** `apps/api/CLAUDE.md`. Build the set once for the PR:
   ```bash
   # all CLAUDE.md that govern any changed file in this PR (deduped)
   git -C <repo> ls-files '**/CLAUDE.md' 'CLAUDE.md'   # candidates that exist
   ```
   Then, per changed file, keep the root one + any whose directory is a prefix of the file's path. Read each kept `CLAUDE.md` (also honor a global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` if its rules are general). If the PR touches a path with its own `CLAUDE.md`, **that file's rules are in scope for those changes** — don't judge `apps/api` code by `apps/admin`'s rules.

4. **Find the linked ticket and read the intent.** Look in the PR body and branch name for a tracker id (`ENG-123`, `PROJ-45`, "Closes …", a Linear/Jira URL). If found, fetch it via the connected tracker MCP (`get_issue` / Jira get-issue) for the **intended behavior + acceptance criteria**. You'll use this in step 5 to check the code actually does what was asked — and to flag scope drift (PR does more or less than the ticket). No ticket linked → note it (a missing ticket link is itself a small finding) and review on the diff alone.

5. **Review the diff — three lenses, verified before kept.** For each PR, cover:
   - **a. CLAUDE.md conformance** — go rule by rule through the in-scope `CLAUDE.md` set (step 3): conventions, comment policy, structure, naming, anything it mandates. Every violation cites the exact file:line and the rule it breaks.
   - **b. Logic / correctness** — does the change do what the ticket (step 4) asked? Off-by-one, wrong branch, unhandled error/null, broken edge case, race, missing await, security-sensitive input at a trust boundary, scope drift vs the ticket.
   - **c. Code quality** — clarity, dead code, duplication, an obvious simpler form, missing test for non-trivial logic. (Keep quality nits few and high-value; don't bikeshed.)

   **Reuse the specialized reviewers** as the engine where they exist: run them in parallel, scoped to the changed areas — `frontend-reviewer` for frontend paths, `backend-reviewer` for backend/API/db paths, `security-reviewer` whenever the diff touches auth, routes, secrets, uploads, redirects, or untrusted input. Give each the diff + the relevant file list. You own the two things they don't: the **CLAUDE.md-rule** pass and the **ticket-intent** cross-check. Then **adversarially verify before keeping a finding** — re-read the cited lines and drop anything you can't defend from the actual code (a wrong public review comment is worse than a missed nit). Each surviving finding: `file:line` · one-line problem · severity **blocking** / **nit**.

6. **Draft the comments (anti-slop).** Turn surviving findings into review comments a good engineer would leave — see the style block below. Group by PR. Inline comments for line-specific findings; one short summary comment per PR for the overall verdict. If there are zero real findings, say so (an approving one-liner) — don't manufacture comments to look busy.

7. **Confirm, then post.** Show the drafted comments per PR and the proposed action. Then:
   - **`postMode: "confirm"` (default)** — post **only** after the user okays it (they can edit/drop any comment first). This is the guard against putting AI slop on a colleague's PR.
   - **`postMode: "auto"`** or the user said "post them" / "post directly" — for a **single PR**, post without the extra prompt. For the **bulk "all PRs"** path, `auto` is the riskiest mode (one run scatters AI-drafted comments across many colleagues' PRs, tedious to retract) — still show the PR list + total comment count and post on **one batch OK**; don't fan out public comments to a dozen people with zero human in the loop.
   - Post with `gh`: inline line comments via `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{n}/comments` (or `gh pr review <n> --comment -F <body>` for a single review with the summary). Use `--comment` (a neutral review), **not** `--approve` / `--request-changes`, unless the user explicitly asked you to approve or block. Reviewing your **own** PR can't request changes anyway — post as comments.

8. **Report.** One line per PR: # + title + N comments posted (or drafted, if not confirmed) + the verdict (looks good / has blocking issues / nits only). For "review all PRs", a short table; name any PR you skipped (draft, too large, no diff) so nothing is silently dropped.

## The anti-slop review comment
Write like a teammate dropping a note on a line — short, specific, kind, actionable. Same bar as the `ticket` skill.

- **Inline, blocking** — name the problem and the fix in a sentence or two:
  > `apps/api/src/orders.ts:88` — `total` is summed before the discount is applied, so coupon orders over-charge. Move the discount subtraction above the `round()`. (Ticket ENG-123 says the coupon must apply to the line total.)
- **Inline, CLAUDE.md rule** — quote the rule:
  > `apps/admin/src/Table.tsx:40` — `apps/admin/CLAUDE.md` says no inline styles; this uses `style={{…}}`. Move it to the stylesheet/util.
- **Inline, nit** — flag it as optional: prefix `nit:` so the author knows it's not blocking.
- **Summary comment** — 2–4 lines: what the PR does, the verdict, and the blocking items by reference. Example: *"Does what ENG-123 asks. One blocker (orders.ts:88 over-charges coupon orders) + 2 nits. Logic otherwise reads clean."*

Rules for the prose: plain present tense, like a Slack message. No *comprehensive / robust / seamless / leverage / utilize*, no emoji spam, no "As an AI", no praise padding. Cite real `file:line`, real symbols. One finding per comment. If it isn't actionable, don't post it.

## Rules
- **Nothing public without consent.** Default `postMode: confirm` — show drafts, post only on the user's OK. `auto` only when configured or the user said so this run, and even then the **bulk** "all PRs" path keeps a single batch confirmation (count + PR list) — `auto` skips the prompt for a single PR, never for a fan-out across many people's PRs. Never `--approve` / `--request-changes` unless explicitly asked.
- **Right rules for the right code.** A changed file is judged against its own `CLAUDE.md` ancestry (root + nested), never another app's. Scope it per file (step 3).
- **Verify before you post.** Re-read the cited lines; drop any finding you can't defend from the actual diff. A confidently wrong comment on someone's PR is the failure mode to avoid.
- **Signal over volume.** A few real findings beat twenty nits. Zero issues → say it in one line; don't invent comments.
- **Check intent, not just syntax.** When a ticket is linked, the most useful finding is "this doesn't do what the ticket asked" / "this does more than the ticket asked" — look for it.
- **Reuse, don't reinvent.** Use the project's reviewer agents / `code-review` skill as the quality engine; this skill adds the CLAUDE.md-rule pass, the ticket cross-check, target resolution, and posting. Discover MCPs live and degrade gracefully when one's absent.
