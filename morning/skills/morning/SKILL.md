description: Your morning briefing in one command. Pulls the three things you wake up to and triages each into a scannable digest — (1) open GitHub PRs in your repos that aren't yours and you haven't approved yet, reviewed against each project's CLAUDE.md + logic + quality via the review-prs skill; (2) your Linear/Jira tickets assigned to you, sorted by a real urgency-then-effort order (so urgent items and quick wins surface first) and grouped by project, each with a one-line what-it-is and a how-big-and-hard chip; (3) Slack — every mention of you, DM, and urgent thread, plus a compact summary of unread, sorted the same way. Gathers your repos + watched Slack channels once and remembers them per machine; degrades gracefully when a tracker or Slack MCP isn't connected. Use when the user says "morning routine", "do my morning", "morning briefing", "what's on my plate", or invokes /morning. Runs in the MAIN thread so it can ask once and confirm before any PR comment is posted.

# morning — the morning conductor

You (the **main thread**) turn "do my morning routine" into one scannable briefing across the three places work lands overnight: **PRs to review**, **tickets assigned to me**, and **Slack**. You triage each — sorted and compacted so the user can see, at a glance, what's urgent, what's small, and what's worth opening. You only orchestrate: PR review is the `review-prs` skill, tickets come from the connected tracker, Slack from the Slack MCP. **Read-everything by default; the only thing that writes is a PR comment, and that goes through review-prs's confirm gate.**

## Config (per machine)
State lives in `~/.claude/morning.local.json` (machine-level, since "my repos" and "my channels" follow the person, not a repo). Ask only for what's missing; remember `declined` so you never re-ask.

```jsonc
{
  "version": 1,
  "github":  { "repos": ["org/web", "org/api"] },   // repos to scan for PRs; [] or "current" = the repo you're in
  "prFilter": "is:open -author:@me",                  // which PRs are "mine to review"; gh search syntax. PRs you've already approved are dropped on top of this (step 2) — search can't express "not approved by me"
  "slack":   { "status": "set|declined", "channels": ["#eng", "#bugs"], "handle": "@max", "userId": "U…" },
  "review":  { "postMode": "confirm" }                // confirm (default) | auto — passed through to review-prs
}
```

Tracker (Linear/Jira) + team/project are **not** stored here — reuse the `ticket` skill's `<repo>/.claude/tickets.local.json`, or detect the connected tracker MCP and ask once (the same gate `ticket`/`investigator` use).

## Use any MCP you can see
Discover what's connected **this session** (`claude mcp list` + this session's deferred-tool list) and load schemas with **ToolSearch** before calling. Each section uses what's there and **skips with a one-line note** if its MCP is absent — never block the whole briefing on one missing integration:
- **GitHub** — `gh` CLI (always present if installed).
- **Tracker — Linear *or* Jira** — `list_issues`/`get_issue` (Linear) or the Jira equivalent; reuse the saved mapping.
- **Slack** — `slack_search_public_and_private`, `slack_read_channel`, `slack_read_thread`, `slack_search_users`, `slack_read_user_profile`.

## Steps

1. **Resolve config + identity.** Read `~/.claude/morning.local.json`. Fill gaps once (AskUserQuestion): which **repos** to scan (offer the current repo + any you can infer), which **Slack channels** matter (or "just mentions + DMs"). Resolve "me": GitHub `gh api user --jq .login`; Linear current user (`get_user` "me"); Slack handle via `slack_search_users` on the user's name/email (`max.levchuk@fiveirongolf.com`) — cache the ids. Save.

2. **Section A — PRs to review.** For each configured repo, `gh pr list --repo <r> --state open --search "<prFilter>" --json number,title,author,url,latestReviews`, then **drop any PR you've already approved** — GitHub search has no `approved-by` qualifier, so cut them client-side: `--jq '[.[] | select((.latestReviews // []) | any(.author.login == "<me>" and .state == "APPROVED") | not)]'`. These are the PRs still *awaiting your review* (default: open, not authored by you, not yet approved by you). A PR you approved and that was then pushed to still reads as approved here and stays dropped until you re-review — that's intended for a morning glance. For each, run the **review-prs** skill to analyze the PR — it scopes the CLAUDE.md rules to the changed paths, cross-checks the linked ticket, and finds logic/quality issues, reusing the reviewer agents. Its confirm gate already holds every comment, so **nothing is posted from the briefing** — surface a one-line verdict per PR (looks good / N blocking / nits) with the top issue, then list the PRs that have findings and offer "post the review comments?" rather than posting silently. Many PRs → review the highest-traffic / oldest-waiting first and say how many you covered.

3. **Section B — My tickets, logically sorted.** Pull issues **assigned to me** in an actionable state (Todo / In Progress / current cycle or sprint; skip Done/Canceled) via the tracker. For each, capture: project, priority, estimate/points if set, due date, and a **one-line plain-English "what it is"** (from the title + first lines of the description — not a paste). Then **sort and group** (see the sort model below) and present as a grouped checklist with dimension chips so the user can see urgency, effort, and size at a glance. Offer to hand any picked ticket to the **investigator** / `loop-engine` to actually run — don't start anything unprompted.

4. **Section C — Slack, compacted.** Using the Slack MCP:
   - **Mentions of me** — `slack_search_public_and_private` for the user's handle/`<@userId>` since ~last working day; read each in context (`slack_read_thread`) enough to summarize the ask.
   - **DMs + urgent** — direct messages and anything with urgency markers (asked a direct question, "blocker", "urgent", "can you", a deadline, ping in an incident channel).
   - **Unread digest** — for the watched channels, a compact summary of unread: who needs what, decisions made, threads worth opening. Don't transcribe — summarize.
   - Sort the same way as tickets (most-urgent / needs-a-reply-from-me first), each as one line: who · channel/DM · the ask · link.

5. **Assemble the briefing, then humanize.** One scannable digest, three sections, urgent-first within each. Keep it tight — this is a glance-and-go, not a report. End with a short **"do first"** suggestion (the 1–3 highest-leverage items across all three) and the open offers (post the PR comments? run a ticket in the loop?). If a section's MCP wasn't connected, show the section header with a one-line "not connected — skipped" so the user knows it wasn't forgotten. **Run the assembled prose** (the section summaries and the Slack/ticket one-liners — not the chips, links, or ids) **through the `humanizer` skill** so it reads like notes you'd jot for yourself, not an AI digest. (PR comments are already humanized inside review-prs.)

## Sort model (tickets and Slack)
Rank so the user sees the shape of the day, not just a flat list:
1. **Urgency first** — explicit priority (Urgent > High > Med > Low), then due-date/SLA, then "blocks someone else" or "a person is waiting on a reply". A direct question in Slack or a reviewer waiting on a PR counts as urgent.
2. **Within an urgency band, surface quick wins** — small/low-effort items before big ones, so the user can clear easy things fast. Flag the genuinely **big/hard** ones (large estimate, vague scope, cross-system) so they're planned, not started cold.
3. **Group by project** (tickets) / by channel-vs-DM (Slack) so context-switching is visible.
4. **Show the dimensions, don't hide them** — every item carries chips: `[project] [priority] [~effort S/M/L] [state]`. Effort = the tracker's estimate/points if set, else your S/M/L read of how big **and** how hard the scope is — call it an estimate. The order is a suggestion; the chips let the user re-prioritize at a glance.

## Rules
- **Read-only by default.** The briefing only reads. The single thing that can write — a PR review comment — is held behind review-prs's confirm gate; never post, reply in Slack, or change a ticket without the user asking.
- **Ask once, remember forever.** Repos, channels, and the post mode are gathered on first run and saved; `declined` is permanent. The user edits `~/.claude/morning.local.json` to change them.
- **Degrade, don't fail.** No tracker MCP → skip Section B with a note. No Slack MCP → skip Section C with a note. No repos configured → use the current repo. One missing piece never kills the briefing.
- **Compact over complete.** Summarize Slack and ticket descriptions to one line each; the user opens the link for detail. A morning briefing that takes five minutes to read defeats the purpose.
- **Humanize the prose.** The assembled briefing runs through the `humanizer` skill (step 5) so it reads human, not AI-generated — prose only; ids, links, and chips stay verbatim. PR comments are humanized within review-prs.
- **Nothing silently dropped.** If you cap PRs reviewed or unread channels summarized, say how many you covered and what's left.
- **Reuse the pieces.** PR review = `review-prs`; running a ticket = `investigator` / `loop-engine`; tracker mapping = the `ticket` skill's config. You orchestrate and sort; you don't reimplement any of them.
