cat <<'DONE'

Done. Next:
  1. Restart Claude Code (so the skills and any MCP tools load).
  2. Connect a Linear or Atlassian (Jira) MCP and a Slack MCP for the full morning briefing.
  3. Use them in any project — no command needed:
       "do my morning routine"        or  /morning
       "review all PRs"               "review this PR: <url>"   or  /review-prs

First /morning asks once for the repos to scan + Slack channels, then remembers them
in ~/.claude/morning.local.json. PR comments are always shown for your OK before
anything is posted to a colleague's PR.
DONE
