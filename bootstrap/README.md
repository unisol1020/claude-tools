# bootstrap

One command that takes a repo — and a teammate's fresh machine — from nothing to ready for this Claude Code setup. No more "which extensions do I need, and how do I wire them up?" A teammate clones a repo, runs `/bootstrap`, and the toolchain gets installed, configured, indexed, and the repo gets recorded as done. After that, a session-start hook nudges anyone who opens a repo that hasn't been bootstrapped yet, so nobody works in a half-configured project by accident.

## How it works

`/bootstrap` runs a fixed sequence per repo. The setup step installs only what's missing (idempotent — safe to re-run), and the slow steps ask before they run.

```

Walkthrough: `setup-env.sh` checks each tool with `command -v` and installs the gaps — `brew install ripgrep`, `codegraph` via volta/npm then `codegraph install -y` to wire its MCP, `graphifyy` via uv/pipx then `graphify install` for the skill, and the ponytail + claude-mem plugins written into `~/.claude/settings.json`. Then `/bootstrap` builds the CodeGraph index (asking first on a large repo), optionally builds the graphify graph, and — only if a graph got built — offers a per-commit hook that refreshes it on every `git commit`. It augments the repo's `CLAUDE.md` and, by default, writes the standard `## Code Comments` policy (no comments by default; one-line `why` only) verbatim into `CLAUDE.md` plus any existing `AGENTS.md` / `AGENT.md` (root and nested), then appends the repo path to `~/.claude/.bootstrapped-projects` so the session-start nudge stops firing for it.

Plugins and the CodeGraph MCP only surface after a Claude Code restart — `/bootstrap` says so at the end.

## What you get

| Piece | Role |
|------|------|
| `skills/bootstrap/SKILL.md` | the `/bootstrap` flow Claude runs per repo |
| `skills/bootstrap/setup-env.sh` | idempotent installer for the toolchain — also runnable standalone from a terminal |
| `skills/bootstrap/install-graphify-sync.sh` | wires the per-commit graphify auto-sync hook into a repo's `.claude/` |
| `skills/bootstrap/code-comments.md` | the canonical `## Code Comments` policy block written verbatim into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` / `AGENT.md` |
| `skills/bootstrap/templates/` | the `graphify-sync.sh` / `graphify-sync.py` files that hook copies into a repo |
| `hooks/bootstrap-check.sh` | SessionStart nudge — fires in any project not yet in `.bootstrapped-projects` |
| `install.sh` | symlinks the skill + nudge hook, wires the SessionStart hooks into `settings.json` |

The toolchain it installs:

| Tool | What it is | How it's installed |
|------|-----------|--------------------|
| **ripgrep** | the `rg` binary, fast search | `brew install ripgrep` |
| **CodeGraph** | `@colbymchenry/codegraph` CLI + its MCP server, then a built index of the repo | volta/npm install → `codegraph install -y` → `codegraph init` |
| **graphify** | the `graphifyy` PyPI package (provides the `graphify` CLI, Python 3.10+) + the `/graphify` skill | `uv tool install graphifyy` (or pipx) → `graphify install` |
| **ponytail** | the [ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail) plugin — lazy-senior-dev mode (YAGNI, stdlib-first, fewest lines) | marketplace + enable written to `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| **claude-mem** | the [claude-mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) plugin — cross-session memory + the `/learn-codebase` priming skill | marketplace + enable written to `~/.claude/settings.json` |

## Install — send this README to Claude Code

> **🤖 Claude Code — if a user sent you this README, install it now. Steps:**
>
> 1. **Preflight.** Confirm `git`, `jq`, and the `claude` CLI are on PATH.
> 2. **Clone (idempotent):**
>    ```bash
>    git clone https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools.git ~/.claude-tools 2>/dev/null \
>      || git -C ~/.claude-tools pull --ff-only
>    ```
> 3. **Run the installer** (symlinks the `/bootstrap` skill + the nudge hook, wires the SessionStart hooks into `settings.json` — backs it up first):
>    ```bash
>    bash ~/.claude-tools/bootstrap/install.sh
>    ```
>    Add `--with-deps` to also install the toolchain (ripgrep / CodeGraph / graphify / ponytail / claude-mem) right now. **Ask the user first** — it runs brew / npm / uv.
> 4. **Verify:** `ls -la ~/.claude/skills/bootstrap` is a symlink into `~/.claude-tools/bootstrap`.
> 5. **Report back:** tell the user to **restart Claude Code once**, then open any repo and run **`/bootstrap`** — it installs the required extensions if missing, builds the CodeGraph index, offers `/graphify`, and records the repo. The ponytail + claude-mem plugins and the CodeGraph MCP surface after the restart.
>
> Update later with `git -C ~/.claude-tools pull` — the symlink picks it up.

### Requirements

macOS or Linux, [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), `git`, and `jq`. For the toolchain: `node`/`npm` (or volta) for CodeGraph, `python3` for graphify, and Homebrew for ripgrep. The installer fills the gaps it can.

### Manual install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools.git ~/.claude-tools
~/.claude-tools/bootstrap/install.sh          # add --with-deps to also install the toolchain now
```

Then restart Claude Code.

## Use it

The teammate path, start to finish:

1. Install this once (above), restart Claude Code.
2. Open any repo. Claude nudges you that it isn't bootstrapped.
3. Run **`/bootstrap`**. It installs what's missing, indexes the repo, asks before the slow steps (large-repo indexing, `/graphify`, `/learn-codebase`), and records the repo as done.

Want to set the toolchain up from a terminal without opening a repo? Run the bundled script directly — it installs only what's missing:

```bash
bash ~/.claude/skills/bootstrap/setup-env.sh
```

### Per-commit graphify auto-sync

If `/bootstrap` built a graphify graph, it offers a `PostToolUse` hook (written to the repo's `.claude/settings.local.json`). After every `git commit`, the hook runs a silent AST pass that refreshes `graphify-out/graph.json` from the commit's changed code files — zero tokens, the model is never involved. The files land in the repo's `.claude/`, which is personal and gitignored, so it's never imposed on teammates via shared git hooks. Code stays fresh automatically; **doc/README/spec changes still need a manual `/graphify --update`**.

## Privacy

`~/.claude/.bootstrapped-projects` lists the real repo paths you've set up. It lives under `~/.claude` and is never committed to this (or any) repo — only the generic tooling ships here.

## Uninstall

```bash
rm ~/.claude/skills/bootstrap ~/.claude/hooks/bootstrap-check.sh
# then remove the SessionStart entries for bootstrap-check.sh and the codegraph sync from ~/.claude/settings.json
```
