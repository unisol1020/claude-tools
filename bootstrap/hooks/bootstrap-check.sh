# SessionStart additionalContext; Claude then acts on it.

msg="This project is NOT yet bootstrapped (absent from ~/.claude/.bootstrapped-projects). Before other work, run the /bootstrap flow for this repo: install/verify the required extensions (ripgrep, CodeGraph + its MCP, graphify, the caveman plugin) via the bundled setup script, build the CodeGraph index (ask before indexing a large repo), offer to run /graphify, create or augment CLAUDE.md, then append \"$d\" as a new line to ~/.claude/.bootstrapped-projects (create the file if missing, no duplicates). If the user gave an urgent task, ask whether to bootstrap first or proceed; if they decline, skip and do not re-offer this session."
