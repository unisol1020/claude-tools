# claude-tools

My kit of **Claude Code** tools — agents, skills, and config that install into `~/.claude` and work in any local project. Each one is a top-level folder with its own README and a one-line installer. Take the whole set, or just the one you want, by sending a README to Claude Code and saying *"install this"*.

The set has a shape: **bootstrap** gets a machine and a repo ready, **cmux** is the desktop environment you run Claude Code in, **qa**, **tickets**, and **morning** are the everyday helpers, and **loop** is the autonomous capstone that reuses qa and tickets to take a ticket all the way to an approved PR on its own.

## How the tools fit together

## Tools

| Tool | What it does | Install by link |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| [**bootstrap**](bootstrap/README.md) | `/bootstrap` — one command that readies a repo and a fresh machine: installs/verifies the toolchain it expects (ripgrep, CodeGraph + MCP, graphify, ponytail, claude-mem), builds the CodeGraph index, offers `/graphify`, augments `CLAUDE.md`, and records the repo so the session-start nudge stops. Start here when onboarding. | *"install this: https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools/blob/main/bootstrap/README.md"* |
| [**cmux**](cmux/README.md) | A full **cmux + Ghostty + Claude Code** environment, captured 1:1 — glass terminal (Catppuccin, transparent/blurred), file-opens routed into **Cursor** at the git repo root, a colored statusline, merged Claude settings, and a `db-tui` terminal SQL-client launcher. Backs up every file it touches; macOS only. | *"install this: https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools/blob/main/cmux/README.md"* |
| [**qa**](qa/README.md) | A `manual-qa` agent that drives a real browser to check a feature *works* (functional, via Playwright) or *matches the design* (Figma / pixel-perfect). Remembers per-project URL + login + DB, asks once. | *"install this: https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools/blob/main/qa/README.md"* |
| [**tickets**](tickets/README.md) | A `ticket` skill that writes **human-readable** Linear / Jira tickets (not AI slop) — repro + how-to-verify + where the problem lives — pulls Figma/Sentry/Slack context from connected MCPs, and posts test results as a comment. | *"install this: https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools/blob/main/tickets/README.md"* |
| [**morning**](morning/README.md) | A `morning` skill — *"do my morning routine"* / `/morning` — that triages the three things you wake up to into one scannable briefing: open PRs in your repos that aren't yours (reviewed against each project's `CLAUDE.md` + the linked ticket + logic/quality), your assigned Linear/Jira tickets sorted urgency-then-effort and grouped by project, and Slack mentions / DMs / unread. Ships a standalone **`review-prs`** skill too — *"review all PRs"* / *"review this PR: <url>"*. PR comments are held for your OK before anything posts. Reuses qa's reviewer agents, the `ticket` config, and `loop`. | *"install this: https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools/blob/main/morning/README.md"* |
| [**loop**](loop/README.md) | An autonomous **loop engine** + an **investigator**. Say *"get 10 tickets from Linear and check them"* → it triages into a checkbox list (run / skip / investigate-only), and on your OK fans out one loop per ticket. Each loop: plan once → implement → `CLAUDE.md` rule-check → manual QA → PR to the dev branch → poll comments → stop on approval. Per-task git worktree + isolated Docker stack (own DB, own ports). Reuses **qa**, **tickets**, and `/loop`. | *"install this: https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools/blob/main/loop/README.md"* |

Each tool's README has its own self-install block, so you can install them one at a time. The `loop` tool reuses `qa` and `tickets`, so install those alongside it.

## Install everything — just send this README to Claude Code

You don't run anything. Paste this file (or its URL) into **Claude Code** and say *"install this"*.

> **🤖 Claude Code — if a user sent you this README, install every tool in this repo now. Do not ask setup questions (each tool gathers its own per-project setup on first use, not at install). Steps:**
>
> 1. **Preflight.** Confirm `git` and the `claude` CLI are on PATH. If either is missing, stop and tell the user to install it first.
> 2. **Clone (idempotent):**
>    ```bash
>    git clone https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools.git ~/.claude-tools 2>/dev/null \
>      || git -C ~/.claude-tools pull --ff-only
>    ```
> 3. **Run every tool's installer:**
>    ```bash
>    for f in ~/.claude-tools/*/install.sh; do echo "== $f =="; bash "$f"; done
>    ```
>    Each installer symlinks its agent/skill into `~/.claude/` (so a later `git pull` updates everything) and registers or checks for the MCP it needs. They're idempotent — safe to re-run.
> 4. **Verify:** `ls -la ~/.claude/agents ~/.claude/skills` shows symlinks pointing into `~/.claude-tools/*`.
> 5. **Report back to the user** — confirm what installed (bootstrap, cmux, qa, tickets, loop), call out any `✗` dependency lines an installer printed (with the `brew`/`npm` fix), tell them to **restart Claude Code once** so agents / skills / MCP tools load, then summarize each tool in a line or two (paraphrase the per-tool READMEs; keep it short).
>
> Update later with `git -C ~/.claude-tools pull` (symlinks pick it up). Uninstall: see each tool's README, or the bottom of this file.

Requirements: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) and `git` for everything. Node.js (`npx`) for the Playwright MCP that `qa` uses. The `loop` tool also wants Docker + `jq` + `gh`, and `cmux` is macOS-only. Per-tool requirements are in each tool's README.

### Manual install (if you'd rather)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unisol1020/claude-tools.git ~/.claude-tools
for f in ~/.claude-tools/*/install.sh; do bash "$f"; done
```
Then restart Claude Code.

## Adding a new tool to this repo

Each tool is a top-level directory with its own `README.md` (including a `🤖`-prefixed self-install block), an executable `install.sh` that symlinks its pieces into `~/.claude/`, and a `skills/` and/or `agents/` directory. Mirror an existing tool's layout and the repo-level installer loop above picks it up automatically.

## Uninstall

Run each tool's uninstall (see its README), then optionally remove the clone:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.claude-tools
```
